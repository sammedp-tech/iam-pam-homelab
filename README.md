# iam-pam-homelab
This repository helps you build a fully functional Identity and Privileged Access Management (IAM &amp; PAM) home lab on your personal machine using Windows and Linux virtual machines.  You will recreate real-world identity and privilege issues commonly seen in enterprise environments, understand risks they introduce, and learn how they are remediated.
